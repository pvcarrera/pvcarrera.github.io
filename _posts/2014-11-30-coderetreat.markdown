Two weeks ago I had the opportunity to attend the [GDCR][coderetreat] at
 [Pivotal Labs][pivotal] London offices. It was my third time participating in this event.
 The previous editions I went to were at [Agil-AZ][agilaz] offices in Santiago de Compostela (Spain)
 in 2011, and [Skills Matter][skillsmatter] London (UK) in 2012.

My review about the GDR is going to be about the changes I've noticed between these three editions.
 I’m going to focus on 4 points: knowledge of the problem, languages used, expertise of the
 attendants, community growth and coding practices.

* Knowledge of the problem: In the first edition almost nobody knew about
 [Conway's Game of Life][gameoflife] so the whole morning was spent familiarising with it.
 It had already changed a bit in the second event I attended, but I noticed a massive shift
 this year, since all the people I paired with knew about it. This allowed us to focus more
 on the practises and less in understanding the problem itself, so it was a very positive switch.

* Languages: Java has been the language mainly used in these three editions.
 However, I’ve seen how the amount of people with some knowledge of functional
 languages have steadily increased. I was also expecting a massive rise in dynamic languages like
 Ruby or Python but, as far as I observed, their growth seems to have stabilised.

* Expertise of the assistants: I was pleasantly surprised at how all three editions kept a good
 proportion between experts and novices. The balance maybe tilted a bit towards newcomers,
 but generally speaking it was a well adjusted crowd.

* Community: From my point of view, the community hasn’t expanded too much, since the faces I could
 see in all three editions were more or less the same. But I’ve observed a strengthening in the
 relationships between members. The bonds among members in [LSCC][craftcommunity] are very strong,
 and I believe the same happens with the members of [Axilmente][axilmente]. It looks like most
 of them have been fighting battles together.

* Practices: The focus on good practises like SOLID, TDD, etc. is becoming a standard *de facto*
 for the [GDCR][coderetreat]. In the first and second editions, facilitators had to explain what TDD
 was, asking people to concentrate on quality. In the last edition, however, all the people I
 paired with or talked to had a solid knowledge of these practices and many were convinced TDD
 users, focused on code quality.

Of course, it’s worth stressing that my opinion is probably quite biased because I only attended
 this event at three very specific places. Therefore, it might not be easily extrapolated to other
 locations.

Finally, I would like to thank all the organisers, facilitators and sponsors. The celebration of
 this event would be impossible without them.

PS: If you are looking for a deeper insight on code retreat and the patterns arising from
 its practice, I recommend you take a look at this book:
 [Understanding the Four Rules of Simple Design][4rules] by Corey Haines, cofounder of Coderetreat.
