For you who don’t know me, I see myself as a software developer and a sportsman. I’m not entirely
 sure which of both I feel more passionate about.

During the last few years, I’ve been trying to create a personal blog but I could never find the
 inspiration to get on with it. But now I’m about to start a new stage in my life which will
 hopefully be full of challenges and changes. Thus, I’m feeling that this could be the right time
 to give it a try.

I would like to start with a set of rules for my blog:

* Content doesn’t matter. Posts can be about software developing, working out, or
 whatever is in my mind when I'm writing the article.
* Articles should be written in a maximum of 2 [pomodoros][pomodoro]
* These rules can change in time, their purpose is to keep me focused.

Things that I would like to achieve through this blog:

* Improving my communication skills.
* Reinforcing my weekly technical learning.
* Keeping track of my workouts and fitness progress.
* Building a personal brand.
* Getting out of my comfort zone and opening my mind.
* Organising my ideas.

Welcome to my blog!
