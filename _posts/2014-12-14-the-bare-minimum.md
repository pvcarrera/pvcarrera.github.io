This last month has been full of changes, mainly because I switched work and country. During this period, the time
I've dedicated to my workout and code training has been reduced.

It's not the first time I've had to endure a tight schedule and, if there is something I've learnt,
is that you have to keep doing at least a liitle bit of training and never stop altogether.
This will allow you to return to your previous timetable without a massive effort.

As with my previous post, this one is going to be a reminder for myself, so that when I face another time shortage
or I feel drained of energy and need a break, I can come here and remember my bare minimum
training routines.

Workout routine
---------------

### When I don't have access to weights

* **Chest chair dips:** 6 sets of 6 reps (30s. rest between sets)
* 30 s. / 1 min. rest
* **Chest push ups:** 6 sets of 6 reps (30s. rest between sets)
* 30 s. / 1 min. rest

* **Squat jumps:** 6 sets of 6 reps (30s. rest between sets)

* **Abs crunches:** 6 sets of 15 reps (15s. rest between sets)

Apart from this strength workout, I try to go for a 20-30 mins run two or three times per week.
It doesn't matter if the run is after a workout or on a day off,
the only rule is not to run before the workout.

My two pomodoros for writing this post are far gone, so I'll talk about the bare minimum code training routine in
the next one. See you!
