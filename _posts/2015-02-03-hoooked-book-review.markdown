This is my first review about a book, funny because it's also the first book I have ever read about building products.

*Hooked* is about how to build habit forming products like Facebook, Twitter or FarmVille. Its core theory is based on [BJ Fogg's  Behavioural Model][behavioural] but focused on products and how to hook users.

Basically the **The Hook Model** follows this scheme:

The first step is an **External Trigger**, for example an email, a tv advert or something similar.

The previous step should trigger an **Action** that the user is going to make through the product/app, such as posting a tweet or checking Facebook.

From this the user will get a **Variable Reward** triggering dopamine in the user's brain, who will be waiting to get more of it with the next loop.

This feeling of reward/release is going to make the user expend time on the product. This **Investment** will make the user increase the perception of the product's value (like when you build IKEA furniture yourself).

Eventually this enjoyment will turn into an **Internal Trigger** that, of course, will be reinforced with the use of **External Triggers** again.

This is a massive simplification of the book, but it'll be be a good reminder on how the system works. The author explains each quarter in detail, and he adds a nice section about principles and ethic.

As a rookie in this area, I found the book easy to understand, interesting and instructive.
